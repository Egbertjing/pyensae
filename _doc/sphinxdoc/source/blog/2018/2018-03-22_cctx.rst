    I came accross this package:
    `cctx <https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt>`_.
    The summary is the following:
    *A JavaScript / Python / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 90+ exchanges*.
    The library is available in javascript, php, python but
    the last two languages are obtained by translating the
    javascript into python and php.
    There are a few commits per day.
    That's moght be worth following if you
    are interested cryptocurrencies.
